= Bind

Bind actions to various file system events, helping aid in
automation of tasks such as refreshing browser(s) when you
update a css / sass / js file.

== Executable

The 'bind' executable allows you to perform arbitrary actions
based on several events. Currently only the change (mtime) event
is supported.

Bind to a single file, outputting its path when changed
  $ rbind to style.css -e 'puts file.path'

Bind to glob 
  $ rbind to stylesheets/*.css -e 'puts file.path'

Bind to ruby glob (allows recursion) note the quotes
  $ rbind to 'stylesheets/**/*.css' -e 'puts file.path'

Refresh Safari, and Firefox in the background to the uri specified when 
style.css or reset.css are modified.
  $ rbind refresh http://localhost/page --paths style.css,reset.css --browsers Safari,Firefox

Refresh local static html when the style you are working on is modified.
  $ rbind refresh examples/demo.html -f style.css -b Safari

== Library

Bind of course supplies a Ruby library as well, which provides the same 
functionality as the executable above.


Refresh Safari and Firefox, using the RefreshBrowsersHaml action, whenever a haml or
sass file is modified, it will be compiled to '..' (up a directory) preceding the refresh.

  path = 'http://localhost'
  action = Bind::Actions::RefreshBrowsersHaml.new path, '..', 'Safari', 'Firefox'
  listener = Bind::Listener.new :interval => 1, :debug => $stdout, :action => action, :paths => Dir['*.haml'] + Dir['*.sass']
  listener.run!
